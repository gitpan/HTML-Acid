<h3>The first<br/> test</h3 class="really_end">
<em>This</em> is a very conformant
<a href="http://www.w3c.org" title="eXtended HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</a>
fragment. <span class="outrageous">I hope you like it</span>. I will be using it as test material</em>
during the development of this module. Actually not just <em>development</em>
but subsequent <strong>support</strong> will both use this and variant 
files for regression tests. <h3 id="play_havoc">Blah<p>This paragraph is intended to include <br/>all the<br/>
features permitted in our restricted subset of HTML. Therefore I need to
include an utterly gratuitous
<img alt="a gratuitous image" src="http://www.google.co.uk" height="100000" title="a gratuitous image" width="100000"><a id="/blah" title="Woo I;m invisible"><br/></a>
at no extra cost.</p><p>










</p>
<p>This second paragraph is likely to be a bit shorter. However I cannot
entirely guarantee that. That is I might have to revise that prediction
once the paragraph is complete.</p>
<h3 id="test2">The big idea</h3>
<p>Actually I am sorry to <span class="invisible">admit</span> it, but I am running out of ideas for 
test material. I mean I really needed a second header and so I had to 
have yet another paragraph. I do apologize for any inconvenience reading 
this <strong>material may have caused you.
