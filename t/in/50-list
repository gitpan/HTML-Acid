<h3 id="test1">The first test</h3>
<p>This is a very conformant
<a href="/xhtml#def" title="eXtended HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</a>
fragment. I hope you like it. I will be using it as test material
during the development of this module. Actually not just <em>development</em>
but subsequent <strong>support</strong> will both use this and variant 
files for regression tests. This paragraph is intended to include all the
features permitted in our restricted subset of HTML. Therefore I need to
include an utterly gratuitous
<img alt="a gratuitous image" height="100000" src="/image/gratuitous" title="a gratuitous image" width="100000" />
at no extra cost.</p>
<p>This second paragraph is likely to be a bit shorter. However I cannot
entirely guarantee that. That is I might have to revise that prediction
once the paragraph is complete.</p>
<h3 id="test2">The big idea</h3>
<p>Actually I am sorry to admit it, but I am running out of ideas for 
test material. I mean I really needed a second header and so I had to 
have yet another paragraph. I do apologize for any inconvenience reading 
this material may have caused you.</p>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>I am sure you hate lists, right? Well I apologize for presenting
some lists but I do need to test some lists.</p>
<ol>
 <li>dog</li>
 <li>felines (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">wikipedia</a>)</li>
 <li>large lumbering <em>hippopotamus</em> and tasty <strong>pig</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The following list comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_list#Task_list">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<ul>
 <li>map out everything that is important by making a task list</li>
 <li>create an oasis of time for one to control</li>
 <li>say "no"</li>
 <li>set priorities</li>
 <li>don't drop everything</li>
 <li>don't think a critical task will get done in spare time</li>
</ul>
